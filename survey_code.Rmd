This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```{r import data }

## manually delete the second and third rows (about notes) before importing data 
data <- read.csv("test_data.csv", header = TRUE)

```





## Including Plots




```{r Question1, echo=TRUE  }
## The options for these questions measure the degree of respondent agreement or disagreement, and to show the degree to which respondents agreed with each aspect of the academic experience, I calculated the mean of the answer scores for each aspect and used bar charts to show the differences in the mean scores for the different aspects of the scores.

## In this question, the higher the score for each indicator, the higher the average level of satisfaction across all respondents.

library(ggplot2)

## fill missing value（"Not applicable" answer）as 0 (if needed). This makes the mean calculation independent of missing values, and adding zeros does not change the calculated mean value.
